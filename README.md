## Tips After taking classes!
#### For C1-Week4 2nd assignment : You should change the code as follows.
        # Print the cost every 100 training example
        if cost and i % 100 == 0:
            print("Cost after iteration {}: {}".format(i, np.squeeze(cost)))
        if cost and i % 100 == 0:
            costs.append(cost)
